# IBM-Capstone
This project explores which programming and tech skills are really in demand right now. By digging into job postings, online training sites, and developer surveys like Stack Overflow’s latest report, the goal is to spot real-world trends and understand what tools and technologies developers are using—and what employers are actually looking for.
